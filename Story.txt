Once upon a time in a village far far away, there lived a family of 3 hens. Mother hen, and her two daughters, Cluck and Click. They were happy most of the time but sometimes they faced a slight issue. Mother hen went to the doctor with this issue. The issue was that whenever she used to call Cluck, Click used to come to her and whenever she used to call Click, Cluck used to come to her. The docotor's solution was very simple, name Click, Cluck and Cluck, Click.
